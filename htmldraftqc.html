        <p>Who am I? A brand new queer coder, and this blog is 
        my love letter to the queer tech pioneers, and the Uncle Sam poster to people 
        who think that this field is too difficult to start in. I have a background in 
        English and education, and made this jump at the age of 27. I hope my unique 
        perspective will encourage yall, and these articles about tech in entertainment 
        will inspire you. Interviews and profile pieces on queer pioneers, along with deep 
        dives on the inherently queer nature of code will show you that the web is the place
        for queer folks like us.
