        <p>Who am I? A brand new queer coder, and this blog is 
        my love letter to the queer tech pioneers, and the Uncle Sam poster to people 
        who think that this field is too difficult to start in. I have a background in 
        English and education, and made this jump at the age of 27. I hope my unique 
        perspective will encourage yall, and these articles about tech in entertainment 
        will inspire you. Interviews and profile pieces on queer pioneers, along with deep 
        dives on the inherently queer nature of code will show you that the web is the place
        for queer folks like us.

    <article id="htmlPunkAf"><h2>HTML is Punk AF.</h2>
        <p>When you think about pulling up google to diagnose the weird rash on your back,
            you may not think of it as 'punk,' but rest assured that no cred will be lost
            with your search on the web. In fact, the World Wide Web has had over thirty years
            experience with practicing DIY ethics, for better or worse. Now you may be wondering 
            to yourselves how something as ubiquitous as the internet could be more punk than you,
            so let's dive in. First up: <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners Lee.</a>

        <p>Tim Berners Lee was born in 1955 in England. You could say he was destined for greatness, 
            at least in the tech field; both his parents were early computer scientists. In fact, his
            whole family is remarkable, but let's stay focused. sdfjlwoeij
