        <p>Who am I? A brand new queer coder, and this blog is 
        my love letter to the queer tech pioneers, and the Uncle Sam poster to people 
        who think that this field is too difficult to start in. I have a background in 
        English and education, and made this jump at the age of 27. I hope my unique 
        perspective will encourage yall, and these articles about tech in entertainment 
        will inspire you. Interviews and profile pieces on queer pioneers, along with deep 
        dives on the inherently queer nature of code will show you that the web is the place
        for queer folks like us.

    article id="htmlPunkAf"><h2>HTML is Punk AF.</h2>
        <p>When you think about pulling up google to diagnose the weird rash on your back,
            you may not think of it as 'punk,' but rest assured that no cred will be lost
            with your search on the web. In fact, the World Wide Web has had over thirty years
            experience with practicing DIY ethics, for better or worse. Now you may be wondering 
            to yourselves how something as ubiquitous as the internet could be more punk than you,
            so let's dive in. First up: <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners Lee.</a>
        
        <p><img src= "timbernerslee.jpg" alt= "Tim Berners Lee at computer"></p>
        <p>Tim Berners Lee was born in 1955 in England. You could say he was destined for greatness, 
            at least in the tech field; both his parents were early computer scientists. In fact, his
            whole family is remarkable, but let's stay focused. Excelling all throughout school, Lee eventually graduated from Oxford 
            with a Bachelor's Degree in physics, and reportedly made himself a computer from an old television set while completing classes.
            Obviously, just an underachiver, right? 
         </p>
         <p>After graduation, Lee worked in telecommunications before ending up at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN#Computer_science">CERN</a>
            , a research facility that, among other things, boasts particle accelerators and an extensive computer science laboratory. While there,
            Lee became annoyed with the difficulty of working across multiple computers that didn't share files with each other. So annoyed, that he 
            sent a memo to his bosses pitching the idea of having links to referenced pages in documents, so rather than having to read an article, then 
        hunt for the article it referenced, you could access it with a click of a button, and that it could be done by linking computers in a virtual
        'web' of sorts... see where this is headed? This idea wasn't new, in fact, it was decades old, but the way in which it would be used was revolutionary.
        Other groups had set out on this quest to bring order and communication to the internet, but most were doing so to make a profit, locking articles behind
        paywalls. Lee was setting out to make an open source project, in which anyone in the world could access these files, making the World Wide Web a place for 
        everyone. </p>
