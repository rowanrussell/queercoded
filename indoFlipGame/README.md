//Indonesian Flip Card game

//Stage 1 MVP: takes user input in prompts, then displays correct responses. At the end, displays questions with user input and correct answer. 
Research: Can I alternate alerts and prompts, like: prompt, then alert with answer, then prompt, etc. 

Stage 2 MVP: Does everything in stage 1, but gives feedback (correct, incorrect). Would also like to give users 3x try before correct answer is given. 
Research: loops for input. How can I make sure the answers are marked as correct(true), regardless of casing? 

Stage 3: Make it more like a game. Get rid of prompts, turn into flip cards. User writes answer on “front” of card, then correct answer is on back of card. 
Research: How to make canvas/ interactable input forms, add sounds? Maybe CSS for text color, etc. 

Big questions: Can I get my game to interact with translator services? 

Can I get incorrect “cards” shuffled back into the deck?  

How can users save their progress?
